CRITICAL CODE QUALITY VERIFICATION POST-OPTIMIZER

Task: Verify code formatting and quality after optimizer agent work

ISSUES DISCOVERED:
1. Clippy errors in crates/domain/src/config/mod.rs:
   - method `from_str` can be confused for std::str::FromStr::from_str
   - derivable_impls warnings for Default implementations
   
2. Pre-commit hook failures:
   - Format: ✅ OK (cargo fmt --check --all passes)
   - Clippy: ❌ Errors blocking commits
   - Tests: ❌ Failing
   - unwrap() usage: ❌ 1832 calls (limit: 500)

VERIFICATION REQUIRED:
1. Assess what optimizer actually fixed vs what remains
2. Determine severity of each issue (blocking vs non-blocking)
3. Provide fix recommendations for each issue
4. Overall push readiness assessment

EXPECTED DELIVERABLES:
- Comprehensive review of current code quality state
- Analysis of optimizer work effectiveness
- Priority-sorted list of remaining issues
- Push readiness recommendation (READY/NOT_READY/CONDITIONAL)

Files to analyze: crates/domain/src/config/mod.rs, pre-commit hooks, overall project state
